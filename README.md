- Categorize clients into High, Medium, and Low risk using billing & payment behavior  
- Highlight outstanding amounts, revenue gaps, and unprofitable legal matters  
- Track attorney workload, billing efficiency, and time entry audits  
- Enable legal operations teams to prevent issues before escalation
